// Logging is an important tool for understanding what's happening within your application, diagnosing issues, and monitoring its health. Different log levels serve different purposes, and you can use them in various scenarios throughout your project. Here's a general guideline on when to use different log levels:

// Trace and Debug:

// Use trace and debug log levels during development and debugging.
// Use trace for extremely detailed information, such as function calls, variable values, and execution paths.
// Use debug for less detailed information that is still relevant during debugging.
// Log input values, intermediate results, and other information that helps you understand the flow of your code.
// Info:

// Use info level for normal operational messages that provide insights into the application's behavior.
// Log important events like the start of the application, successful authentication, incoming requests, and major processes.
// Use info to provide context for what the application is doing, especially for external observers.
// Warnings:

// Use warn level to indicate potential issues that don't stop the application from functioning but need attention.
// Log situations like deprecated API usage, resource allocation alerts, or situations that might lead to errors if not addressed.
// Errors:

// Use error level to log errors that prevent the application from performing a specific action or task.
// Log exceptions, failed requests, database connection errors, and other critical issues that impact the application's functionality.
// Include stack traces and relevant context to aid in diagnosing the problem.
// Fatal and Emergency:

// Use fatal (if available in your logging library) or emergency (if available in more advanced logging systems) for the most critical issues that require immediate attention.
// Log scenarios where the application is unable to continue functioning, or where data integrity is compromised.
// It's important to strike a balance between logging too much and too little. Too much logging can clutter your logs and make it difficult to find important information, while too little logging might make it hard to diagnose problems. Additionally, in production environments, you might want to keep the log level higher (e.g., warn, error, fatal) to avoid flooding logs with non-essential information.
